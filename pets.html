            <img src="images/bacon.jpg" width="400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different
                beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as
                he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to
                admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p>
            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his
                energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a
                ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>
